# Computer-Graphics-Project
A program that creates 3D images

background of the project. The project in an introduction to software engineering at the Academic Institute, the first parts whit order form lecturer and the latest parts give more free hand for students, at all stages of the project, all bonuses were made.

Description: Computer software that produces a 3D image with many special image features, computer graphics.

An explanation in general of what is in the project and the features that are in it. A program to create 3D images with special effects such as soft shadow and field depth (ie, some of the image is sharp and some of the image blurred) this optional option of frozen objects or objects like water means that their reflection is a bit blurry.

The program requires problem domain: color, geometry, algebra, photography, architecture, etc. The program contains vectors and points created by the programmer rather than modules reserved in the work environment
